# 🔋 Renewable Energy Forecasting using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Summary

With the global shift toward renewable energy, accurate forecasting of variable sources like solar and wind is critical. This project builds a forecasting system that:

- Uses **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and other ML models
- Predicts energy generation based on environmental features
- Provides actionable insights via a dashboard and statistical evaluation

The system was evaluated using standard metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R², showing high accuracy and interpretability, making it suitable for deployment in smart grids and energy planning.
